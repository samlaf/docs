The parties further agree that (i) any claims brought by either party must be brought in such party‚Äôs individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and (ii) the arbitrator may not (x) consolidate more than one person‚Äôs claims, (y) otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding or (z) award class-wide relief.
